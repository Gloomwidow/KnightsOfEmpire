# Introduction 
Knights of Empire - real time online strategy. Enjoy!

# Description
The goal of this project was to create a multiplayer game from the real time strategy genre. With client-server architecture, the game allows to play with multiple players at the same time. It also provides unique unit modification system.
The game was written in C# .Net. SFML.Net library was used for graphics, TGUI.Net for user interface. The communication between client and server is based on TCP and UDP protocols. 
The game's goal is to defeat other players by destroying their bases. In order to do that, players utilise buildings and units that can be created and controlled during the game. Before the match, players can use unit modification system to modify their units with limited selection of upgrades, to make them more suitable to their playstyle.
