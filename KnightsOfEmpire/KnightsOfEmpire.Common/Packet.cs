         * 
         * #### - header, four digits (0-9) to identify what content is in package.
         * For instance, package with header 0125 could mean client's order to move troops. 
         * ***** - actual content of package
         * <EOF> - package end tag. Might subject to change to something more unique, in case content would somehow could have this tag, 
         * ending package unexpectedly.
         * 
         * 
         * We can also use JSON to encode packages, but I'm not sure if the size will be small enough to handle it fast.
         * I leave that to discussion, since messages can be of any shape as long as they are encoded in ASCII.
